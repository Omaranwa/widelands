Auxiliary Scripts
=================

Some Lua scripts come bundled with Widelands (in the ``data/scripting/``
directory).  They can be imported in any script by the :func:`use` function
using "aux" as namespace. Most of those scripts provide some convenience
functionality around the core functions that are easier to use or offer more
flexibility. All functions are imported into the global namespace if not
otherwise stated. All auxiliary scripts are documented in this section.
