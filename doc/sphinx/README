README for the Documentation
============================

This file contains the developer and content creator documentation for
Widelands. The documentation is generated with sphinx, you need to install this
if you want to build the documentation (modules py-sphinx or similar).

Building the documentation for offline reading
----------------------------------------------

First, extract the embedded documentation from the C++ code::

   $ ./extract_rst.py

Then, run ``make`` to see your options. Convenient for off-line reading is
``make html``.


Building the documentation for the webserver
--------------------------------------------

First, build the Sphinx documentation as JSON files:

cd doc/sphinx/
sphinx-build -b json -d build/doctree source build/json

Then add a Sphinx app to the admin panel in the webserver, if this hasn't been
done yet:

1. In the "Sphinxdoc" section, add a new app.
2. Configure the app as follows:
   Name: Widelands developer documentation
   Slug: wl
   Path: <path-to-widelands>/doc/sphinx/build/json/
