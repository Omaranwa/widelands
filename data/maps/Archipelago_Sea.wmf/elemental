descr="Between Sweden and Finland  lies the archipelago sea. This place of incredible beauty is not land, and it is not sea, and it is both. Within a few hundred kilometers, there are no less than 50000 islands and islets, most no more than a few acres across. The climate is quite mild for its latitude; farming thrives, berries abund, and fish are plentiful. The small human population of this place never knew famine. You warlording bastards just couldn't leave this little paradise in peace, couldn't you?"
hint="Large plots are rare on those small islands. Prioritize construction of large buldings on them. Sometimes you need big military buildings to expand all the way to the next island. AI performs poorly."
