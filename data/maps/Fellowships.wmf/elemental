descr="Coal is hard to find – learn to make it efficiently. Starting positions are similar, so the map should be fair. There is plenty of gold near the starting point – Do you see it?"
hint="This map is best suited for two or three human players, with game speed somewhat above the normal value. The AI performed badly at the time of writing (2013)."
